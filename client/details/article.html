            WASHINGTON — Federal agents seized a cellphone belonging to a prominent Republican senator on Wednesday
            night as part of the Justice Department’s investigation into controversial stock trades he made as the novel
            coronavirus first struck the U.S., a law enforcement official said.
            Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, turned over his
            phone to agents after they served a search warrant on the lawmaker at his residence in the Washington area,
            the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss a law enforcement action.

            The seizure represents a significant escalation in the investigation into whether Burr violated a law
            preventing members of Congress from trading on insider information they have gleaned from their official
            work.

            To obtain a search warrant, federal agents and prosecutors must persuade a judge they have probable cause to
            believe a crime has been committed. The law enforcement official said the Justice Department is examining
            Burr’s communications with his broker.


            Such a warrant being served on a sitting U.S. senator would require approval from the highest ranks of the
            Justice Department and is a step that would not be taken lightly. Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department
            spokeswoman, declined to comment.

            A second law enforcement official said FBI agents served a warrant in recent days on Apple to obtain
            information from Burr’s iCloud account and said agents used data obtained from the California-based company
            as part of the evidence used to obtain the warrant for the senator’s phone.
